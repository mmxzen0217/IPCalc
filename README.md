# IPCalc
This is autoit version of IP-Calc
The original code and web site: http://trk.free.fr/ipcalc/

I am a network engineer and i have a lot of job need IP manipuate, the ipcalc is prefect soluation for me.
But it is vbscirpt/javascript version only, so i translate/convert it and share everybody who has work need to be done.

This file not 1:1 clone, i just implement what i need and IPv6 function is totally missing.
I have do some function test but not 100% guarantee, so test it before use it.

what autoit version ip-calc can do:

- increment an IP address 
- IP address sorting 
- calculate a net mask or a wildcard (i.e. inverse mask) 
- check if an address is in a subnet 
- match an address against a list of subnets (similar to Excel VLOOKUP and MATCH functions) 
- find overlapping subnets 
- sort 
- calculate the difference between 2 IP addresses 
- calculate the size of a subnet 
- check if an address is public or private
- IPv4 
+ provide a set of helper functions for IP address parsing so you can easily write your own macro

Thank Thomas Rohmer-Kretz.
