# IPCalc
This is autoit version of IP-Calc
The original code and web site: http://trk.free.fr/ipcalc/

I am a network engineer and i have a lot of job need IP manipuate, the ipcalc is prefect soluation for me.
But it is vbscirpt/javascript version only, so i translate/convert it and share everybody who has work need to be done.

This file not 1:1 clone, i just implement what i need and IPv6 function is totally missing.
I have do some function test but not 100% guarantee, so test it before use it.

Thank Thomas Rohmer-Kretz.
